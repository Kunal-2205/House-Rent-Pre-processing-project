## 🏡✨ House Rent Analysis — Data Cleaning & EDA Project

Unlocking insights from rental data to understand what truly drives house prices.

## 🚀 Project Goal

Transform a messy, real-world rental dataset into a clean, structured, insight-rich foundation that reveals how property features impact rent — and prepare it for future machine learning models.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

This project explores the key question:

“Why do two houses with similar size and rooms have different rents?”

To answer that, the project:

Cleans & preprocesses raw rental data

Extracts meaningful features like Current Floor, Total Floors

Creates rent_per_sqft for fair comparison

Visualizes rent trends across cities, area types, and furnishing levels

## 📝 Problem Statement

Rental datasets are often messy, inconsistent, and incomplete. The challenge is to:

Fix unstructured fields (like “X out of Y” floors)

Handle missing and duplicate values

Remove irrelevant information

Engineer new meaningful features

Analyze how key factors affect rental pricing

This project solves these issues to uncover pricing patterns and prepare the dataset for modeling.

## 📘 Abstract

This study performs systematic data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis on a real-world house rent dataset.
Tasks include handling missing values, converting text-based floor info into numeric fields, feature engineering (e.g., rent_per_sqft), and analyzing rent distributions.
Visual insights highlight how city, furnishing status, area type, and size shape rental prices. The cleaned dataset supports predictive modeling and deeper market understanding.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Done

✔ Extracted Current Floor & Total Floors<br>
✔ Filled missing values intelligently<br>
✔ Removed irrelevant columns (locality, contact info)<br>
✔ Engineered rent_per_sqft<br>
✔ Cleaned text formats & standardized data<br>
✔ Converted categorical features<br>


## 📊 Key EDA Insights

📌 City matters! Some cities consistently have higher rental prices.
📌 Furnishing boosts rent. Furnished > Semi-Furnished > Unfurnished.
📌 Area Type affects cost per sq.ft.
📌 Bigger houses don’t always mean higher rent per sq.ft.
📌 Floor levels impact rent (especially in multi-floor buildings).
Visualizations include barplots, scatterplots, and distribution plots showing these patterns clearly.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project successfully:

Transforms raw rental data into a clean and structured dataset

Extracts valuable new features

Reveals strong insights into how different factors influence rent

The dataset is now fully prepared for machine learning models, price prediction tasks, or deeper analytics.
